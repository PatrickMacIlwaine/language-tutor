# Better Language Learning Tool
There are a lot of tools that people use to learn languages these days. Online tutors, textbooks, mobile apps, flashcards, and more. 
`But they aren't integrated`
With the addition of LLM's we can practice having real conversations with AI in our language of study. 
Now you can practice speaking and real conversation by yourself in your language of study. 
## Integrations
This project uses Amazon Polly, Google Cloud, Open AI, and SpeachRecognition.
